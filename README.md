# BlenderRender

A simple user interface so you don't have to use command lines to launch renders/animation without opening Blender.

The idea is to have something simple enough for any user, whether a beginner or advanced user.

The use of command lines is really interesting, in the case of big rendering, not having to blender opened the time of the render frees up resources.
The interest of the application is to simplify this, through a graphical interface, to make it accessible to all more easily.

In the future I would like to create a rendering queue, so that you can render multiple projects, integrate options and save profiles, to make the application more accessible, customisable and productive.

I create this projet as learning purpose and also I wanted a tool like this, so it's the good moment to do it.

Also, I don't have windows or mac computer, so I'm not sure if I make the release myself for these OS at the moment, without being able to test it.
